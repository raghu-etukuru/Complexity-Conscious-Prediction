# Complexity-Conscious-Prediction Model Execution Steps
Create the Folder, for example, TimeSeries.

Copy the code to the Folder TimeSeries.

Create a subfolder named “input” under TimeSeries.

Copy the CSV files to the “input” folder (This is the Folder where input data is stored).

Create a subfolder named “DataValidity” under TimeSeries. This is the Folder where the complexity measures go.

Create a subfolder named “output” under TimeSeries.

Create two subfolders named “LSTM” and “GAN” under “output”. These are the folders where the output and accuracy metrics go.

Open the Python files from Jupyter Notebook.

Run TS_Data_Complexity_Measures.ipynb.

Run TS_Model_1_LSTM.ipynb.

Run TS_Model_2_GAN.ipynb.

Ensure the GPU/CUDA is adequately configured. This is specifically required for the GAN model to run.
